#simple_notes
This is a responsive HTML5/CSS3 + Bootstrap +JQuery project.

It was a simple weekend project made to have fun.

In this example the data is extracted from the Yahoo! API *(https://query.yahooapis.com) and it is parsed to show the weather forcast based on your location.
The user's ip is also dinamically determined using the ipinfo.io API. *(Give it a try)

In this toy example, requests to the APIs were implemented loading JSON-encoded data from the server using a GET HTTP request. 


Just dont forget that you can take as many notes as you want, as well as edit and erase them.

[Take a look and enjoy](https://beatrizgue87.github.io/simple_notes/)
